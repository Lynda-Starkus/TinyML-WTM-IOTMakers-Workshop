### TinyML : TensorFlow Lite Workshop - Multi-Label Classification for Embedded Devices



#### Introduction : 

This workshop is designed to teach you how to use TensorFlow Lite to perform multi-label classification on embedded devices. TensorFlow Lite is a lightweight version of the popular TensorFlow library, specifically designed for deployment on resource-constrained devices such as smartphones, Raspberry Pi, and other embedded systems.

In this workshop, you will learn how to train a multi-label classification model in TensorFlow, convert the model to TensorFlow Lite, and run the model on an embedded device to make predictions.

We'll also do a proof-of-concept study, where we'll compare different compression strategies in TFlite and how it influences the overall performance of a neural network.


### Prerequisites
Before starting this workshop, you should have a basic understanding of machine learning concepts, basic knowledge of microcontrollers (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, ESPs, NodeMCU, ... etc) and basic experience with TensorFlow.
